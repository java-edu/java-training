what is java?
	a high level language (one of machine language, assembly language, and high-level language)
	object oriented language
		eveything in java is object which has a state and behaviour
	statically typed language
	garbage collected language
	mutithreaded language
	both compiled and interpreted
		.java(source code) --compile|using-javac-> .class(byte code), --interpret|using-jvm-> machine code
	java programs are portable platform independent
		compile once and execute anywhere using jvm
		.java and .class files are machine independent and therefore portable
	secure language
		no explicit use of pointers (no direct access to memory like c)
			helps resolve probelms like memory leakage when garbage is not cleared
		jvm verfies byte-code eg. type safety, inheritance, naming rules etc


JDK, JRE, and JVM
Java Development Kit - JDK
	JDK = JRE + compiler(javac)
Java Runtime Environment - JRE
	JVM + some libraries and other files used by JVM to run byte code
Java Virtual Machine - JVM
	loads, verifies, and exectures byte code (.class files) is executed
	any language code that is converted to bytecode can be run with it


------------------------------

SOME JAVA COMMANDS

	java -version //to check cuurently used java version

	javac JavaFileName.java // to compile
	java JavaFileName // to run


--learn more in java-indepth section
------------------------------

THE MAIN METHOD

	the entry point for JVM to start execution
	main method can accept arguments
		either seperated by spaces
		or arguments that have space in them can be enclosed in double quotes

-------------------------------
NAMING CONVENTION

	case sensitive
	class and interface names
		start with upper case letter
		eg. SampleClassForCommandLineProject
	method names
		start with lower case letter
		generally a verb
	variable names
		start with lower case letter
		rules to declare variable names
			alphabets, numbers, _ and $
			first char cannot be number
			not reserved keywords
			no blank spaces
			no limit for length but keep it short and readable
	contants
		all upper case with underscore for readability
	program file name should match the "public" class name
	package name

---------------------------------------------------------------------------




OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

	mimicking the environment around us using code
	a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic
	with the help of concepts like classes, objects, state, behaviour, inheritance, data hiding, abstraction, polymorphism, message passing...


-------------------------

METHOD

	a collection a statements meant to perform specific task
	method signature = method name + parameter list
		used by jvm to identify methods 
	
-------------------------

VARIABLE

	name of the memory location used for storing and accessing data
	
-------------------------

CLASS

	user-defined data type
	a blueprint of an object (real life entities)
	consists of data memebers and member functions
	
-------------------------

OBJECT
	basic unit in OOP
	represents real life entities
	instance of a class
	has 3 main properties
		identity
			name of the object
		state
			its attributes
			using variables (data members or instance variables)
		behaviour
			actions
			using methods (member functions or instance methods)
	
-------------------------


STRUCTURE OF A TYPICAL JAVA CLASS

	class name
	fields
	methods
	constructors
		default and/or parametrized


-------------------------

new KEYWORD

	create an instance of the class i.e a new object
	allocates the memory at runtime
	returns referece to that memory
	invokes object constructor


-------------------------


STEPS TO CONSTRUCT AN OBJECT

	0. gather info on an object, take vehicle for example
	1. write a class with properties and functions available for that object
	2. declare and define an object using new keyword and class constructor method

EXAMPLE: Vehicle
	a vehicle has state information like, number of name, price, wheels
	a vehicle has behaiours like run and stop


-------------------------

this KEYWORD

	refers to the current class instance (object)
	can be used to access crrent class instance variables implicitly
	can be used to invoke crrent class instance methods implicitly

-------------------------


VARIABLE TYPES

	local
		declared and defined inside a method
		destroyed after method execution
		cannot be accessed from outside the method block
	instance
		declared at class level
		are accessible to all the methods inside the class
		will have one copy for each object instance
	static
		declared at class level
		are accessible to all the methods inside the class
		will have same copy for all object instances
		can be access without even created objects instances

class
	var1
	var2
	static var3

object1
	var1@addr11
	var2@addr12
	var3@addr3
object2
	var1@addr21
	var2@addr22
	var3@addr3


-------------------------

PACKAGES

	group of classes, sub packages and interfaces
	prevents naming conflicts between duplicate class names
	package level access control
	clear code organisation

	package names are in lowecase and sub packages are seperated by "."

	import package.name.Class;   // to import a single class
	import package.name.*;   // to import the whole package

eg.
	import java.util.Scanner;
	import java.util.*;


com.tutorials
com.tutorials.pojo or com.tutorials.model or com.tutorials.entity
com.tutorials.pojo or com.tutorials.model or com.tutorials.entity
com.tutorials.service
com.tutorials.dao
.....




-------------------------


ACCESS MODIFIERS
	helps restrict scope of a class, constructor, variable, method, or data member

4 types
				default/no-mod	private	 protected  public
same class				Yes	  Yes	    Yes	     Yes
same package sub class  		Yes	  No	    Yes	     Yes
same package non sub class		Yes	  No	    Yes	     Yes
different package sub class		No	  No	    Yes	     Yes
different package non sub class		No	  No	    No	     Yes

classes
	public or default
variables, methods and constructors
	default/no-mod	private	 protected  public


-------------------------


NON ACCESS MODIFIERS

	provide information about the characteristics of a class, method, or variable to the JVM

7 types
	static - variables and methods
		variables that will exist independently of any instances created for the class
		methods that will exist independently of any instances created for the class

	final  - variables, methods and classes
		finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables
		final variable can be explicitly initialized only once
		final method cannot be overridden by any subclasses
		final class cannot be extended

	abstract - classes and methods
		abstract class can never be instantiated and can only be extended
		a class cannot be both abstract and final (since a final class cannot be extended)
		abstract class may contain both abstract methods as well normal methods
		method declared without any implementation is abstarct method
		any class that extends an abstract class must implement all the abstract methods of the super class, unless the subclass is also an abstract class
		if a class contains one or more abstract methods, then the class must be declared abstract
		an abstract class does not need to contain abstract methods

	synchronized - method
		a synchronized method can be accessed by only one thread at a time
	
	transient - variable
		skip it when serializing

	volatile - variable
		chnages on one thread are reflected across all threads
		value of a volatile variable is always read from the main memory and not from the local thread cache, and it helps to improve thread performance

	native - method
		indicates that the method is implemented in a language other than java
		and can be executed from java using JNI
		


-------------------------

GETTERS AND SETTERS
	will learn with encapsulation

-------------------------


OOP PRINCIPLES

INHERITANCE

	mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class
	using extends keyword
	is-a relationship
	super and sub class
	reusability

	types: single 1-2, multi-level 1-2-3, hierarchical 1-2.1,-2.2, multiple 1,2=3(not allowed in java), hybrid/circular dependencies(not allowed in java)

	vehicle, car, grandfather, father, son

	class A msg(), class B msg(), class C extends A,B, new C().msg(); //Now which msg() method would be invoked?  
	ambiguity and circular dependencies incase of hybrid inheritance


POLYMORPHISM

	having many forms
	two types:
		method-overloading/compile-time
			change in number of and type of method arguments
			eg. multiply int, double
		method-overriding/runtime
			call to the overridden method is resolved at runtime



ENCAPSULATION

	data hiding
	bundling of data and methods - class
	way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access
	and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the object

	declare instance variables of a class as private
	define public methods called getters and setters
	
	eg. BankAccount with private balance field and credit, debit and getBalance public methods

	read only, write only classes




ABSTRACTION

	implementation hiding
	process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details
	eg. product of two number -> a.b, sum a for b times

	used for writing specifications
	in java using abstract class, abstract method and interfaces

	abstract class:
		declared with abstract keyword - abstract class ClassName
		can have both abstract and concrete methods
		can have variables and constants
		sub class should extend abstract class
		sub class should override abstract methods
		can have constructors but cannot create objects of an abstract class
		eg. calculator with add, sub, multiple, divide

	interface: 100% abstraction
		declared with interface keyword - interface InterfaceName
		says what a class must do and not how
		can have only abstract methods
		can have only constants
		all the methods are public and abstract, and all the fields are public, static, and final by default
		a class should implement an interface
		the implementing class should override all the abstract methods
		abstract keyword is not necessary for methods and are abstract by default
		


-------------------------


OBJECT class

	super class of all the classes by default in java
	methods:
		getClass(), hashCode(), toString()...  	



-------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


CALL BY VALUE AND CALL BY REFERENCE

	in call by value, the modification done to the parameter passed does not reflect in the caller's scope
	in the call by reference, the modification done to the parameter passed are persistent and changes are reflected in the caller's scope

	java is passed by value
		primitives are passed as value
		for objects its reference is passed as value


-------------------------

Some built-in java classes

	Math
		sqrt(), pow(), min(), max(), avg(), sin(), cos()...
	Wrapper Classes
		Integer, Double, Boolean ...
		convert primitive into object and object to primitive
		autoboxing and unboxing
		immutable - creates a new object upon value change
	Date
		LocalDate, LocalTime,  LocalDateTime.. now()..
	String
		is an object that represents sequence of charaters. or simply an array of char
		create using double quotes or using new keyword
			only one literal/string-instance to string constant pool
		length(), equals(), split(), replace(), substring(), isEmpty(), isBlank(), indexOf(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), trim()...
		conactenation - +, conact(), String.format(), String.join()
		immutable
		implements Serializable, Comparable and CharSequence interfaces



-------------------------

EXCEPTION HANDLING

	handle the runtime errors such as NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, SQLException etc...
	java.lang.Throwable class is the root class of Java Exception hierarchy inherited by two subclasses: Exception (RuntimeException--NullPointer..) and Error(StackOverflowError)

	Checked Exceptions
		classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error
	UnChecked Exceptions
		classes that inherit the RuntimeException
		NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException... 

	Error | irrecoverable
		OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc


	important clsases to remember: Throwable, Exception, Error, RuntimeException

How To?
	using try, catch, finally, throw, throws, try-catch, try-catch-catch, try-finally, try-catch-finally
	custom exception by extending Exception class
	
      
Eg.
int data=100/0;  //ArithmeticException
String s=null; System.out.println(s.length());//NullPointerException


-------------------------

COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK
	storing and manipulating a group of objects in a data structure
	ARRAY LIST
	HASH MAP
	HASH SET


-------------------------

STREAM API
	used for various operations especially on collections
	filter, sort, etc

	properties
		stream does not store elements
		stream is functional in nature. ops on a stream does not modify it's source
		elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of a stream
	
	intermediate (map, filter...) and terminal(collect, forEach...) operations
		

eg.
list.stream().filter(a -> a.pages > 0).map(a->a.pages).collect(Collectors.toList())
list.stream().filter(a -> a.pages > 0).forEach()..
	Collectors.summingInt(a->a.pages)
	Collectors.toSet()
	Collectors.toMap(a->a.title, a->a.pages)
	count()

-------------------------


GENERICS
	
	to allow type to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces
	why not Object class? - type safety eg. setting any type values to instance fields
	generic class and methods
	naming convention for type params
		T – type, E – element, K – key, V – value
	example object definition with generics
		BaseType <Type> obj = new BaseType <Type>()
	generally used to create type safe data structures

	
-------------------------


EXTERNAL LIBRARIES

	libraries - collection of classes that have been written by somebody and can be imported in our project for use
	the .jar file | java archive

	eg. Google Guava for MultiMap
	Steps:
		download the library jar file from mvnrepository.com
		right click on your project inside your IDE
		Build Path -> Configure uild Path -> select Classpath -> click add external JARs -> slect your .jar file -> apply and close
		now you can start using library classes and methods


-------------------------


MAVEN
	dependency and build management tool
	comes pre installed with popular IDEs like Eclipse, STS
	current version is 3.9...
	uses pom.xml for configuration of dependency or build instructions
	helps us in automating import of external libraries, building and deploying projects

	local(.m2), central(https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/) and remote(in-house) repository
	search for maven repos https://mvnrepository.com/ or https://central.sonatype.com/?smo=true

	Dependency Management
	steps:
		create a maven project from your IDE
			IDE adds pom.xml and created the right maven project structure for you
		search for your external library on on google with maven as prefix or on https://mvnrepository.com/ 
		copy pom configuration and add it to depdendency section of pom.xml
		now right click on project -> Maven -> Update -> Force Update
		done! start using your libraries classes and methods

	Build Management

Pre-requisite - Basic SQL


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY - JDBC

	a java library to connect and query to databases
		a database is used to store application/software/user data
	there 2 types of databases Relational and Non Relational or SQL and NoSQL
	eg. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis etc


	JDBC API
		provides methods and interfaces to connect with databases through JDBC driver
	JDBC drivers
		java needs jdbc drivers to connect to these databases
		generally every database have their own JDBC librries

-------------------------

ORM - JPA and HIBERNATE

	Object Relational Mapping - ORM
		is a layer that connects object oriented programming to relational databases
	Java Persistence API (now Jakarta Persistence API)
		is a specification to facilitate object-relational mapping to manage relational data in Java applications
		you can work directly with objects instead of using raw sql queries
	Hibernate
		is a java ORM framework
		it implements JPA

	JPA Concepts

-------------------------

DAO Pattern

	Data Access Object pattern
	is a strtuctural pattern that allowes application layer to be isolated  from persisternce layer using abstraction


-------------------------

MUTI-THREADING

	Process
		an instance of a program execution
		is nothing but an executing program
	Thread
		a light-weight process
		basic unit of execution within a given process
		one process can have many threads

	Java is single process and single threaded by default

	Mutithreading?
		is to seperate time consuming tasks eg. sorting or calcuating even and odd numbers from billions of numbers
		or seperate tasks that might interfere execution of other tasks eg. file download, sending an email
		it is the ability of the cpu to exceute multiple tasks concurrently using threads

		advantages
			better performance
			better resource utilization
			better user exeperience with responsive apps

		disadvantages
			syncronization is little complex
			not easy to test (asyn codes)
			it is expensive to create new threads all the time
			number of threads a cpu can handle is limited and by memory and switching time
			after a saturation point increasing threads will decrese performance
	
		rule of thumb : number of threads <= cpu cores for optimum results
		AND do not use unless required

		can a single core CPU have multiple threads?
			yes of course! hundreds of threads are not a problem
			just go into your windows task manager.
	
		how can a single cpu core handle multiple threads?
			using time slicing algorithm
		who decides what thread to be executed?
			thread scheduler generally using preemptive scheduling
			first cme first serve and based on thread priority

	PARALLEL PROGRAMMING
		multiple cores executing multiple threads
		single core can not help you much in terms in performance by using multithreading


	Thread Lifecycle
		new state
			thread is in this state util we call strt() method
		active state
			when we call start()
		blocked/waiting state
			when a thread is waiting for another trhead to finish
		terminated state
			when a thread has finished its task

	Threads can be created in 3 ways in java
		extending thread class
			not recommended because you cannot extend any other classes
		implementing runnable interface
		using anonymous class


	STACK MEMORY
		local variables
		method arguments
		method calls
		each thread has its own stack memory

	HEAP MEMORY
		objects
		static variables
		live as long as it is referenced from somewhere in the application

THE WEB

	the internet
		multiple computers communicating each other
	http - hypertext transfer protocol
		a set of rules that defines how to transfer data between devices over the network
		is a client-server protocol
	servers
		a software that uses http or other protocols to respond client requests
		tomcat, netty, jetty..
	client
		a software that uses http or other protocols to request data from server
		web browsers, mobile apps..


	front-end
		user interface or how a web page looks
		html, css, js, react...
	back-end
		server side software
		java, python, php, golang...
	database
		where user data is stored
		MySQL, Postgres, Mongo....


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


HTTP
	main features
		connectionless - no prior checks to see if the other device is available
		media independent - text, documents, audio, video etc
		stateless - two devices know each other only for the current request and response cycle
	a http transaction involves request and response messages

	Uniform Resource Locator - URL
		a standard way of specifying or accessing a resource on the internet
		syntax: <protocol>://<host><:optional-port>/<path>
		eg. https://www.google.com/search

	Request
		sent by the client to servers
		parts of HTTP Request
			request line, set of headers, a blank line, optional body
		syntax.	<http-method>/<url-path> <http-version>
			<headers..>
			<headers..>

			<body>

		eg1.	GET /search HTTP/1.1
			Host: google.com
			Content-Type: text/html

		eg2.	POST /search HTTP/1.1
			Host: google.com
			Content-Type: application/json

			{
     				"bname": "abcd",
			}
		
	Response
		sent by the server back to client
		parts of HTTP response
			status line, headers, a blank line, optional body
		syntax.	<http-version> <status-code> <status-message>
			<headers..>
			<headers..>

			<body>
		eg.	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
			Content-Type: text/html

			Hello World

	HTTP Methods
		GET - to retrieve data
		HEAD - identical to GET but without response body
		POST - to submit data
		PUT - to update data fully
		PATCH - to partially update data
		DELETE - to delete data
		OPTIONS - to get avialable http methods on an url

	HTTP Status Codes
		Informational responses (100 – 199)
		Successful responses (200 – 299)
		Redirection messages (300 – 399)
		Client error responses (400 – 499)
		Server error responses (500 – 599)
		
		200 OK - success upon get, head, put, post
		201 Created upon post or put
		400 Bad Request
		401 Unauthorized
		403 Forbidden
		404 Not Found
		405 Method Not Allowed
		500 Internal Server Error
		503 Service Unvavailable

	HTTP Headers
		used by client and server to exchange additional information
		case insensitive

		Content-Type: text/html
		Cookie: name=value; name2=value2; name3=value3

WEB DEVELOPMENT STACK

	group of languages or frameworks or libraries or tools that developer or group of developers use to build a web application

	some examples are:
		html, css, js, java, mysql
		react, java, mysql
		jsp, java servlets, mysql
		html, css,  java servlets, mysql
		html, css, js, java spring boot, mysql

---------------------------


SERVLET

	a technology/library/interface/class etc in java used to write web applications
	servlets are executed inside web servers and respond to http requests
	web servers for example tomcat, netty, jetty, jboss etc

	Servlet API
		provides two packages javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http
		interfaces and classes javax.servlet
			Servlet, ServletRequest, ServletResponse, RequestDispatcher, ServletContext ....
			GenericServlet, ServletInputStream, ServletOutputStream, ServletException .... 
		interfaces and classes javax.servlet.http
			HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, HttpSession ...
			HttpServlet, Cookie, HttpServletRequestWrapper, HttpServletResponseWrapper ...

	
	HttpServlet class
		provides methods to work with http protocol
		like doGet, doPost, doPut ...

	Servlet Life Cycle
		Servlet class is loaded (only once)
			when first request is recieved by web container(tomcat)
		Servlet instance is created (only once)
			web container creates it
		init method is invoked (only once)
			web container calls init method containing code for db set up etc..
		service method is invoked
			web container calls the service method each time when request is received
		destroy method is invoked
			destroys the servlet instance


	3 ways to code servlets
		by implementing servlet interface
		by inheriting GenericServlet class
		by inheriting HttpServlet class (mostly used)


	directory structure of servlet project
		project-name(folder)
			WEB-INF(folder)
				classes(folder)
					.class(files)
				web.xml(file)
				lib(folder)
			html, css, js, images...(files)

	deployment descriptor(web.xml)
		an xml file used by web container to get information about servlets


	project: rest-api crud with java servlets, hibernate and mysql
	porject: integrating rest-api crud with front end

REST APIs

	/actor/{id}
		GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods

	4 Richardson maturity levels
		level 0 - evrything using post request
		level 1 - get and post
		level 2 - all https methods/verbs to distinguish between actions
		level 3 - you follow HATEOS


---------------------------


HTTP NAMING CONVENtIONS

	url - small case, seprated by - incase of mulitple words, seperated by / incases of paths
	url parameters - follow the same as url


---------------------------

PROJECT 1 - rest-api crud with java servlets, hibernate and mysql

---------------------------

PROJECT 2 - integrating rest-api crud with front end

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------

Some background...


Inversion of Control - IoC
	transfer of the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework
	can be achieved using patterns like factory, dependency injection etc



Dependency Injection
	connecting objects with other objects, or “injecting” objects into other objects
	loose coupling
	thus two types of dependency injection in java
		Constructor Injection
		Setter Injection


---------------------------


SPRING FRAMEWORK

	framework of frameworks
	provides support to various frameworks such as Hibernate etc
	easy to test, fast development, powerful abstraction
	built as a IoC framework


Spring Modules
	Data Access
		JDBC, ORM, JMS, Transactions
	Web
		web, servlet, struts, portlet
	AOP
	Aspect
	Instrumentation
	Spring Core Container
		core and beans - IoC and Dependency Injection features
		context - I18N, EJB, JMS 
		expression language
	Test



Spring IoC Container
	ApplicationContext interface represents the IoC container in spring
	responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling objects known as beans
	also manages bean life cycles


DI in Spring
	can be done through constructors, setters or fields
	using @Autowired annotation


	Autowire Field
	class Employee{
		@Autowired
		Address address;
	}

	Autowire Setter
	class Employee{
		Address address;

		@Autowired
		void setAddress(Address address){  
			this.address=address;  
		}
	}

	Autowire Construction
	class Employee{  
		Address address;

		@Autowired
		Employee(Address address){  
			this.address=address;  
		}
	}


	the address bean needs to be configured using xml file, @Bean or @Component annotations



---------------------------

SPRING BOOT | SPRING WEB and SPRING JPA

	is a project that is built on the top of the Spring Framework
	rapid application development
	embedded server helps with creating a single standalone deployable jar
	no more boilerplate xml configuration
	production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalised configuration
	it provides starter libraries with some production default configuration for various spring modules


---------------------------

PROJECT 3 - rest-api crud with spring boot, spring jpa and mysql

---------------------------

PROJECT 4 - TODO LIST using java spring boot, html, css and js


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------







JVM

	jvm is a specification
	different orgs or companies like oracle, microsoft, redhat etc have their own implementation jvm.
	these companies provide both free and commericial jvm for use
	
	its job is to load, verify, and execute byte-code
	architecture: major components: classloader, memory area, execution engine, jni
	1. class loader
		loads the .class files (the byte code) into jvm when required
		verifies the code eg. type checking etc
		initialized any static vars or execute static blocks
	2. memory area
		2.1 class/method area
			all class level data
			static variables
			only one per jvm
			not thread safe
		2.2 heap area
			objects, instance variables, arrays
			one per jvm
			not thread safe
		2.3 stack area
			stack frames
			one stack frame per thread
			one stack frame per method lifecycle
			thread safe
		2.4 pc registers
			one per thread
			address of current executing instructions
		2.5 native method stack
			per thread
			native method information
	3. execution engine
		3.1 interpreter
			reads bytecode and executes piece by piece
			even if the same method is executed twice, it will be interpreted twice
		3.2 JIT compiler
			finds repeated code keeps it converted to native code to save it from interpretation effort
		3.3 garbage collector
			removes unreferenced objects
			can be explicitly invoked using System.gc() but not gauranteed because of thread priority

	4. JNI
		helps interact with native method libraries
	



-------------------------------------


STATIC BLOCKS

	executed when the class is loaded in memory
	

so can you run a java class without main method??
	yes but no
	it was possible till java 5




-------------------------------------

ANONYMOUS CLASSES

	inner classes with no name
	since no name, cant create instance or objects
	are declared and used on the spot
	can be created either extending a class or implementing an interface
	syntax:
		new ClassNam(){
			@Override
			method_impl...
		}
		new InterfaceName(){
			method_impl...
		}




-------------------------------------

ASSOCIATION

	another important OOP concept
	two types
	1. IS-A
		car IS A vehicle
		bike IS A vehicle
	2. HAS-A
		employee HAS An address
		student HAS An address




-------------------------------------


SYNCRONIZATION

	in a multithreading environment, synchronization is tha capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource to prevent thread interference or a consistency problem

	the problem: objects in java are stored in heap area and are therfore not thread safe

	the concept:
	mutual exclusion principle (no two concurrent events)
	every object has a lock associated with it
	a thread that needs consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's lock before accessing them, and then release the lock when it's done with them.
	and one of the way to achieve this is by <synchronized> keyword in java

	solution: we can use <synchronized> keyword on a method to lock for its use

	examples of without and with synchronization



-------------------------------------

VOLATILE

	problem: jvm or cpu may cache variable values for faster access and this inturn makes the write action slow because the main memory and cache both needs to be updated
	while memry writes are pretty fast, the cpu might take some time or may be never to update the cache
	thus other threads that are accessing your varible might get late updates or never

	solution: <volatile> keyword does not cache the value of the variable and always read the variable from the main memory
	guarantees visibility and ordering


-------------------------------------


STRING
	sequence of characters
	internally just a character array
	immutable (since arrays are immutable i.e fixed size)
	so when a change is made, a new string instance is created


STRING BUFFER 
	mutable strings
	has synchronized methods 
	therefore thread safe
	therefore slower comparitively


STRING BUILDER
	mutable strings
	has non synchronized methods 
	therefore are not thread safe
	therefore faster comparitively



--------------------------------------------------------------------------


GIT

	source code manament system (SCM) or version control system (VCS)
	maintains history of every change
	developers can collabratively work on same source code
	used for tracking code changes and who made those changes

	terms:
		repository
			working directory or project folder
			local and remote
		branches
			used to create another line of development
			default is master branch
			aka subversion
			can be different working or final versions
		commits
			a point in time state of the repo
		clone
			a copy repo either on local or another remote
		pull
			copies changes from remote to local
		push
			copies changes from local to remote repo
		head
			pointer that always points to the latest commit
		revision
			version of code
			generally represented by commits

	Typical Workflow:
		git branch or git clone or
		edit/code
		stage changes // git add .
		commit to local repository // git commit -m "message"
		push to remote repository // git push


	
	Set Up
		install git
			https://git-scm.com/downloads

		set username and email to tell git who is making changes
			git config --global user.name "java.june23@.gmailcom"
			git config --global user.email "java.june23@.gmailcom"

		sign up on github
		create a public repo
		
	Use	
		clone remote repo on local
			git clone https://github.com/pavanpwm/sample-public-repo.git
		
		code
			add some files
			write code
		
		check changes
			git status // shows intracked files and code changes
		
		stage changes
			git add filename // tell git to trak changes in this file
			git add -A // stage all changes
		
		commit changes
			git commit -m "commit message here"

		view commit history
			git log



	Other Common Commands
		git switch _branch// switch to another branch
		git checkout _branch// create and switch to another branch
		git clone _repo// create a copy of repo
		git diff // show changes between commits
		git fetch // to check if there are any changes on remote repo
		git merge _branch// merge copy changes from remote repo
		git stash // stash changes away
		git stash pop // bring back the the stashed changes
		git revert _commit-hash // essentially creates a new poin copy of commit
		git reset _commit-hash // points the head to that commit
